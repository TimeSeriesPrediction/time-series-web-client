        		<p>As a team, we pride ourselves in all the work we do, development and otherwise. We try to ensure we produce only the most efficient and robust code possible, while attempting to maintain a level of sanity lost to many a developer. By keeping work serious, yet interaction light hearted, we can achieve a balance between efficiency and approachability that ensures team members can find a way to pull through those long coffee filled nights, as well as interact with clients in a way that isn&#39;t as robotic as a conversation with Siri. It is a given with a profession in any technological industry, that keeping up to date with the latest trends ensures the most efficient design. We believe that by making use of only the newest stable frameworks available, we ensure a higher level of security, compatibility, and not to mention internet resources available. Due to this, we as a team are always looking for a challenge, as well as a chance to tackle new opportunities and technologies.</p>

              <p>I am a logical and practical thinker, but I always keep the people around me in mind.

I am out of the ordinary, in the sense that I quickly think of different solutions to a problem. I can apply my knowledge to solve problems fast and effectively. I love working with people, and I believe that taking into consideration all your team partners effort, ideas and an knowledge, will produce the best results.

I am driven, and I do not give up easily. I have the ability to learn fast, and to speak up if I have uncertainties.
I can adapt quite easily to different projects with different team members.

I like to think out of the box when it comes to solving problems and projects. I like to find new ways to simplify how we do everyday tasks.
